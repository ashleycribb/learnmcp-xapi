# LearnMCP-xAPI

LearnMCP-xAPI is an open-source MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables AI agents to record and retrieve learning activities through xAPI-compliant Learning Record Stores. Unlike traditional educational AI tools that focus on content generation or automated grading, LearnMCP-xAPI creates a bridge between AI interactions and learning analytics, allowing intelligent systems to build contextual understanding of what learners know, practice, and achieve.

This project addresses a fundamental gap in AI-powered education: the ability for AI agents to maintain persistent, structured records of learning progress that can inform future interactions and provide evidence of skill development. Whether you're building AI tutoring systems, personalized learning assistants, or educational analytics platforms, LearnMCP-xAPI provides the infrastructure to make AI interactions learning-aware.

> **Important Note:** LearnMCP-xAPI is designed as a foundational component for educational technology systems. It enables AI agents to participate meaningfully in the learning process by maintaining awareness of student progress, but it does not replace thoughtful pedagogical design or human educational expertise.

## Motivation

The current landscape of AI in education is dominated by familiar patterns: pre-made prompts, automated content generation, and the eternal struggle between students wanting AI to do their work and teachers trying to prevent exactly that. This approach treats AI as either a shortcut or an obstacle, missing the transformative potential of intelligent systems that can genuinely support learning.

The inspiration for LearnMCP-xAPI came from observing this fundamental disconnect. Most educational AI tools operate in isolation—they generate responses, create activities, or analyze text, but they don't learn from or contribute to a student's ongoing educational journey. There's no memory of what a student has practiced, struggled with, or mastered. Each interaction starts from zero.

Learning Record Stores (LRS) and the xAPI specification have long provided a solution for capturing and analyzing learning activities, but they've remained largely disconnected from the AI systems that are increasingly central to educational experiences. LearnMCP-xAPI bridges this gap by enabling AI agents to both contribute to and learn from comprehensive learning records.

This approach opens possibilities that go far beyond traditional AI tutoring:

- **Adaptive AI Companions**: AI assistants that adjust their explanations based on what a student has previously learned and where they've struggled.
- **Evidence-Based Assessment**: Teachers can gather authentic evidence of learning from natural AI interactions rather than artificial testing scenarios.
- **Personalized Learning Pathways**: AI systems that recommend next steps based on comprehensive learning histories.
- **Cross-Platform Learning Continuity**: Students' learning progress follows them across different AI-powered educational tools.

The goal isn't to replace human teachers or traditional learning methods, but to create AI systems that can meaningfully participate in the learning process—understanding context, building on prior knowledge, and contributing to a richer, more personalized educational experience.

## How LearnMCP-xAPI Works

LearnMCP-xAPI implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create a seamless connection between AI agents and learning analytics infrastructure. The system operates as a bridge, translating natural language learning interactions into structured xAPI statements while providing AI agents with contextual awareness of student progress.

1. **AI Agent Integration**: Through MCP, AI agents gain access to three core learning tools: statement recording, progress retrieval, and activity vocabulary management.

2. **Natural Language Processing**: LearnMCP-xAPI enables two complementary approaches to learning activity capture:
   - **Explicit Learning Activities**: When students directly mention their learning—"I practiced Python loops today" or "I'm struggling with quadratic equations"—the AI agent converts these into structured statements.
   - **Implicit Learning Evidence**: AI agents can analyze conversations to identify demonstrated knowledge or gaps, automatically recording evidence like "Student successfully explained recursion concepts" or "Student showed confusion with database joins" based on the natural flow of educational dialogue.

3. **xAPI Statement Generation**: LearnMCP-xAPI transforms learning activities into xAPI-compliant statements that include the learner (actor), the activity (verb + object), context, and results. These statements conform to educational data standards and can include scores, completion status, and additional metadata.

4. **Learning Record Store Integration**: Statements are securely stored in any xAPI 1.0.3 compliant LRS. The system handles authentication, validation, and error recovery automatically.

5. **Contextual Retrieval**: AI agents can query learning histories to understand what students have practiced, achieved, or struggled with. This enables responses that build on prior knowledge and address individual learning needs.

6. **Privacy-Preserving Design**: Each student receives a unique identifier (ACTOR_UUID) that separates their learning records while maintaining privacy. No personal information is stored—only learning activities and progress indicators.

This architecture enables AI systems to participate in the complete learning cycle: they can understand where students are coming from, contribute meaningful educational interactions, and build evidence of learning progress that benefits both students and educators.

### Configuration

LearnMCP-xAPI uses a flexible configuration system supporting both environment variables and configuration files.

#### Basic Setup (Environment Variables)

Copy the example configuration file and customize it for your setup:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your LRS plugin selection and student identifier:

```bash
# Required: Choose your LRS plugin

#### Advanced Setup (Configuration Files)

For more complex deployments, you can use configuration files:

```bash
# Create configuration directory structure
mkdir -p config/plugins

# Create LRS-specific configuration files
echo "endpoint: \${LRSQL_ENDPOINT:-http://localhost:8080}
key: \${LRSQL_KEY}
secret: \${LRSQL_SECRET}
timeout: 30
retry_attempts: 3" > config/plugins/lrsql.yaml
